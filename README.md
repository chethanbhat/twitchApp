# twitchApp
Web App using Twitch TV API built as a part of Project for Free Code Camp. 

Twitch.tv - https://www.twitch.tv/ is a live video streaming platform. 

It has API - https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API which helps us to build custom apps. 

The twitchApp which I built aims to retrieve information of Twitch Channels and let us know whether they are Online or Offline. 

This is a part of Front End Zipline Challenge for Free Code Camp - https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api
